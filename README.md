The current evolution of AI, and of Generative AI in particular, namely Large Language Models (LLMs), makes it possible to adopt them as supporting tools for the engineering of information systems, in particular for their design and development. The goal of this tutorial is to instruct the attendees about AI and Generative AI and LLMs, with an IS engineering attitude, and then to focus on recent approaches and applications for their usage during the design and development of ISs. The concept of "low design" and assistant (a.k.a. "smart twin") is introduced as a possible evolution of IS engineering. \
Here the slides of the tutorial given on the 5th of June 2024 at CAiSE 2024 in Limassol (Cyprus) are published (cf. https://cyprusconferences.org/caise2024/tutorials/ and https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/bbm:978-3-031-61057-8/1).
